        <p id="orange1">Educating and transforming hustling men into Demigods.</p>
        <p>In the past 6 years I have gathered Divine tier experience in the field of strength training and guiding determined men towards achieving their purpose relating to health, confidence, strength and productivity.</p>
        <p id="orange">I am a certified strength trainer as well as a holistic nutritionist. My training journey began as a teenager doing calisthenics, then proceeding to powerlifting collecting numerous titles on bench press competitions.</p>
        <p id="border">I have written 1000+ workout plans for clients as a proof of properly programmed training leading to faster and greater results.</p>
        <p id="orange">Later on as an entrepreneur, athlete, actor and singer I have discovered how much of an advantage physical strength means in all these areas. My mission became to seek out those men of purpose, who are ready to wake up the Demigod living within them. My goal is to make YOU the strongest, healthiest and most influential leader you can ever become.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have amassed an outstanding international community full of strength enthusiasts like myself. I can’t put into words the satisfaction I get seeing my programs generate such successful and remarkable transformations.</p>
        <p id="orange">From the first video message I received from a satisfied client with about hitting 2 plates on the bench while 2x-ing his business revenue, to the most recent young business owner telling me he gained 10 lbs of LEAN MUSCLE in only 12 weeks – It always fills me with joy.</p>
        <p>If you are tired of staying low-confidence, weak and poorly performing – It is YOUR time to become a Demigod.</p>
